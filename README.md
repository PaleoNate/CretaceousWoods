This repository holds the data and code used in Jud et al. 2018 Science Advances 4(9):eaar8568 (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aar8568) and the earlier article Jud et al. 2017 IAWA Journal 38(2): 141â€“161 (DOI: 10.1163/22941932-20170164).

The dataset consists of a table of fossil wood occurences: their geographic location, identity, size, age, preservation, and citation information.
The code is an R script for creating plots to expore those data and create Figure 1b from the paper.

The code can be updated to create new plots, and to include new occurrences from the literature or additional details about existing occurences.
