This repository holds the data and code used in Jud et al. 2018 Science Advances 4(9):eaar8568 (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aar8568).
The dataset consists of a table of fossil wood occurences: their geographic location, identity, size, age, preservation, and citation information.
The code is an R script for creating plots to expore those data and create Figure 1b from the paper.

The code can be updated to generate new plots, and the data can be updated with new occurrences from the literature or additional details about existing occurences.
